 <h1>Sambi's Greatest Movies Ever</h1>
 <h2>Littiest Top 5 list ranked in no particular order</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Born on The Fourth of July</h3>
 <p>Tom Cruise did a good job acting here, also I am a sucker for movies based on war veterans</p>

 <h3>The Lego Movie</h3>
 <p>Really funny despite being a movie for kids and has some really dope themes about self belief and finding meaning in ones life</p>
 
 <h3>The God Father (1 and 2 NOT 3)</h3>
 <p>Classic for a reason, actual peak cinema, seeing the corruption of inoccence to evil was cool</p>
 
 <h3>Barbie</h3>
 <p>Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie did an excellent job, funny and cool musicals + bashing of partiarchy</p>


 <h3>Upgrade</h3>
 <p>Underrated sci fi movie, if you have an interest in AI this should peak your interest</p>
